## Why SSRUI 

What's SSRUI? SSRUI is a gridea theme, modified from [clover](https://github.com/idealclover/Clover). I do like clover, it's simple, clean and elegant. However I can not use it on Gridea. Clover is designed for typecho, which isa different blog framework with gridea. Also, Clover is in Pre-relase stage. I decide to modify it and make my own theme.

## How to use 

Just copy SSRUI to your gridea theme folder.
